# HRNet - Jquery to React - OpenClassRooms Project N¬∞14 

14th and and last project of the OpenClassRooms's diploma training program

The project aimed to recreate an existing project which was originally written in JQuery as a react app.

One of the main goal was to choose one of the jquery plugin originaly used (date picker, table, select or modal) 
and rewrite it in react and publishing it on as librairy on NPM, I rewrote all of them.
